# ascee_pings

This is a trivial project to generate 'ping' messages for my corporation, [Ascendance (ASCEE)](https://ascee.goonfleet.com/) in the MMO space game Eve Online

The generated messages are then sent out to the other other players using jabber.

The reason for the tool is to reduce the number of mistakes, either from missing or innacurate data.

# ASCEE is recruiting!
